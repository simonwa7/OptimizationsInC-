Add And Optimize Algorithm Ouline

Basic Idea: attempt to add a gate, but first check if it cancels with any of the
gates already in the circuit

1. Take gate on input, update unoptimized values (length, numCNOT)
2. Go to current tail of qubit looking to be added to
	a. Do these two gates cancel? 
		i. If yes, remove gate, update optimized values (length, numCNOT), STOP
		ii. If no, check if new gate commutes with current gate
			- If yes, recurse to step a. with the previous gate to "current", if previous is NULL, add gate, STOP
			- If no, add new gate, STOP
