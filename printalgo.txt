Printing Algorithm Outline:

1. Create a vector containing pointers to gates that are the next gate to be printed for each qubit

2. Looping through this vector...
	a. When the next gate is NULL (no more gates), stop and go to the next qubit
	b. If the gate is a CNOT control or CNOT target gate...
		- Get the pointer to the next gate for the other qubit in this CNOT
		- While we are not at the corresponding CNOT gate...
			1. Recurse to step b
		- Print out the CNOT gate and update the other qubit's next gate
	c. If not a CNOT, print out this gate
	d. Go to the next gate in this qubit's list
